  ### The Product
  UX design for a childrens bookstore mobile app that offers suitable age and content books for childrens

  ### The Project
  As a new mom to a sweet little boy, I wanted to find some nice books he could read and learn from. Sounds easy right? So I thought. It appears that most bookstore apps are not very child-oriented, and finding the right books for age and content has become quite a challenge. So I have decided to put on my UX designer hat and go out into the wild to explore new ideas and solutions for such apps. 

  ### The Problem
  Parents are struggling in finding content-appropriate books for their children. This is because bookstore apps often do not offer enough children-oriented information about the books they sell.

  ### Interviews

  I have performed interviews with the potential target audiences. We have discussed the various aspects of finding and buying children's books, guided by the following questions:
  1. Please describe the way you search and buy a book
  2. What are the reasons you buy a children's book?
  3. What leads you in choosing a book?
  4. What difficulties did you encounter while searching for a book to buy
  5. What would you improve in the experience of searching and buying books?

  ### Empathy maps

  Next, I used empathy maps as a tool to emphasize with the users farthermore, and to identify the users needs.
  In Adam's Empathy Map I have broken down all the important needs and points that came up from the interview with him and that the app can address.
