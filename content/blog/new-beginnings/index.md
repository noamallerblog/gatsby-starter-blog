  ### The Product
  UX design for a childrens bookstore mobile app that offers suitable age and content books for childrens

  ### The Project
  As a new mom to a sweet little boy, I wanted to find some nice books he could read and learn from. Sounds easy right? So I thought. It appears that most bookstore apps are not very child-oriented, and finding the right books for age and content has become quite a challenge. So I have decided to put on my UX designer hat and go out into the wild to explore new ideas and solutions for such apps. 

  ### The Problem
  Parents are struggling in finding content-appropriate books for their children. This is because bookstore apps often do not offer enough children-oriented information about the books they sell.
